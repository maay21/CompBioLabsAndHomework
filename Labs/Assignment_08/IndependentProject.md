# The Relationship Between Barn Swallows and Glucocorticoid Hormone Concentrations
## Independent Project 
### Marina Ayala, Computational Biology, University of Colorado Boulder Spring 2020

## Introduction
I thought it would be intriguing to examine a dataset from the Safran Lab. The Safran Lab examines ["Integrative Evolutionary Ecology: ecological & evolutionary connections between phenotypic variation and population-level patterns"](http://www.safran-lab.com/). The main study system is [Barn Swallows](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Barn_Swallow/id), and the research is led by the [Dr. Rebecca Safran](https://www.colorado.edu/ebio/rebecca-safran), the lab Principal Investigator, among others across the world. I am excited to be a part of the lab research team this summer, so I thought the Safran Lab research would be a great place to examine data. The study I chose was ["An experimental analysis of the heritability of variation in glucocorticoid concentrations in a wild avian population"](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2014.1302). My driving question for this project is: does the amount of glucocorticoid hormone in blood plasma under baseline conditions differ significantly from levels under stressful situations?
(Jenkins, et al., 2014). 

## Summary of Data to be Analyzed
### Goals of the original study that produced the data:
Glucocorticoid hormones (CORT) fluctuate throughout a barn swallow's lifetime, such as "during seasons, within a season, and during different life-history stages (territory aqusition, breeding and nestling provisioning, moult, and migration), inclement weather, food availability, etc." (Jenkins, et al., 2014, pg. 2). The researchers examined the effects of baseline CORT concentrations and the correlation it has among-individual variability due to genetic variation (Jenkins, et al., 2014). The study was conducted in wild avian populations so that the relationship between genetic and environmental factors that could be influencing CORT secretion patterns could be analyzed (Jenkins, et al., 2014). The blood samples obtained from both baseline and stress-induced plasma were used to determine if phenotypic variance (VP) is due to genetic (VG) and environmental (VE) factors that influence CORT concentrations (Jenkins, et al., 2014). The overall goal was to determine if there is natural variation within CORT responses among barn swallows (Jenkins, et al., 2014). 
### Brief description of methodology that produced the data:
The barn swallows that were observed were from horse barns and culverts around Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld counties in Colorado (Jenkins, et al., 2014). They were observed from May to July in 2010 (the barn swallow breeding season) (Jenkins, et al., 2014). There was both control nests (animals were handled and blood samples were taken) and test nests that either were increased or decreased in brood size, which were also handled and blood samples were taken. Nestlings that were transferred were marked on their leg with nontoxic marker until they were large enough to be banded  (Jenkins, et al., 2014). On day 12 after the transfer, baseline CORT concentration blood samples were taken from nestlings within about 3 minutes of disturbance (Jenkins, et al., 2014). The researchers then waited 15 minutes to take the stress CORT concentration blood sample (Jenkins, et al., 2014). The adults were captured using mist nets or by hand, and marked with nontoxic marker and bands in order to be identified (Jenkins, et al., 2014). All the blood samples from parents and nestlings alike were analyzed further in the lab.
### Type of data in this data set:
The data contains the data that the researchers gathered in the field. It contains the band number, development, site banded, nest recipient, nest origin, date, treatment reared, baseline (ng/mL), stress (ng/mL), latency time, etc. It is a massive dataset with a lot of information about each individual bird that they examined, such as coloration, mites, plasma content, etc. There are also two text files. One contains a pedigree, and the other contains the data used to construct the pedigree based on the relatedness of the father, mother, and nestlings. 
#### Format of data:
It is formatted in both a .csv and two .txt files.
#### Size of data: 
It is 72KB all together. The .csv file alone is 45KB, and it is 7,168 lines of data in total. Altogether, it is a very large dataset.
#### Any inconsistencies:
I am unsure of exactly how the pedrigree was constructed. There is not a file explaining exactly what each variable means, and there is a lot of unexplained data in both .txt files. I am not using that data in my analysis of glucocorticoid hormone levels in the barn swallow blood samples over time. If I wanted to construct and re-model the pedigree, it would be difficult since the data has little explanation for how it is configured. There is also not a file explaining what each variable means in the spreadsheet data, but for those I do not understand, I will not use in my analysis. It would be helpful if there was a file explaining each variable and the units used to denote them. There is a brief paragraph on Dryad explaining that one of the .txt files is in a format that is more compatible with R, and the other was used to calculate heritability, but I think both of these could be elaborated on further. 
#### What does the data represent about biology?
This dataset represents the relationship between phenotypic variance and it's correlation to blood glucocorticoid concentrations (Jenkins, et al., 2014). [Glucocorticoid, any steroid hormone that is produced by the adrenal gland and is known particularly for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions](https://www.britannica.com/science/glucocorticoid) (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018) Glucocorticoid is nicknamed the ["stress hormone"](http://e.hormone.tulane.edu/learning/corticoids.html), because it is often is released when an organism is in physical or emotional stress ("The Hormones : Corticoids"). In relation to barn swallows, the release of glucocorticoid hormone has both a genetic and environmental effect (phenotypic variance), but is strongly due to the rearing environment (Jenkins, et al., 2014). Further studies can be conducted that measure heritability of CORT hormone plasma levels, which ultimately may have an effect on barn swallow fitness (Jenkins, et al., 2014).

## Detailed Description of Analysis to be Done and Challenges Involved
I want to analyze the data by constructing a plot of glucocorticoid hormone levels in both baseline vs. stress through a box and whisker plot with 95% confidence intervals. Comparing baseline CORT to stress CORT over elapsed time can be analyzed for significance by constructing a two-way ANOVA test. If the data is significant, the p-value will be smaller than 0.05. If not, it will be larger than 0.05. It may be difficult to run a two-way ANOVA test on this data, because I may encounter some issues with choosing which time to use, baseline, stress, or elapsed time. This may require construction of several graphs in order to illustrate the data for all the different amounts of time. I have only ran a two-way ANOVA once, so this may be challenging for me to see if it even works to test significance for this data or if I may need to run another kind of significance test.
