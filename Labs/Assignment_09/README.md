# The Relationship Between Barn Swallows and Glucocorticoid Hormone Concentrations in Blood Plasma

### Marina Ayala, EBIO 4420, University of Colorado Boulder

## Biological Question
### Does the amount of glucocorticoid hormone in blood plasma under baseline conditions differ significantly from levels under stressful situations? (Jenkins, et. al 2014).

## Context
#### The study I chose to examine is ["An experimental analysis of the heritability of variation in glucocorticoid concentrations in a wild avian population"](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2014.1302). The main study system of this study is barn swallows. Barn swallows are a type of wild bird that can be found across the globe. They are a great study system because their nests are usually near human populations, so they are often easy to find (Barn Swallow Identification, All About Birds, Cornell Lab of Ornithology, 2019). In terms of glucocorticoid hormone, or CORT, it is [any steroid hormone that is produced by the adrenal gland and is known particularly for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions](https://www.britannica.com/science/glucocorticoid) (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018). Glucocorticoid hormone is not only present in barn swallows, but it is also present in humans (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2018). Glucocorticoid is nicknamed the ["stress hormone"](http://e.hormone.tulane.edu/learning/corticoids.html), because it is often is released when an organism is in physical or emotional stress (The Hormones : Corticoids,n.d.). In relation to barn swallows, the release of glucocorticoid hormone has both a genetic and environmental effect, which is strongly due to how the mothers raise their nestlings (Jenkins, et. al 2014).

## How the data was produced
#### The data for this dataset was produced through field observations, and through lab work. Blood samples from the brachial vein were taken at initial time of nest disturbance, and then another blood sample was taken 15-60 minutes after the inital disturbance in the field (Jenkins, et. al, 2014). The researchers were disturbing the nest in order to move nestlings that hatched around same time to different nests in order to analyze the effect of brood size on genotypes (Jenkins, et, al. 2014). The blood samples that were obtained from the barn swallows in the field were taken back to the lab and further analyzed to test for the presence of glucocorticoid hormone, and other genetic markers (Jenkins, et, al. 2014). The researchers "separated the blood from plasma in the samples through centrifugation" (Jenkins, et, al. 2014, 3). Bands were also placed on several adult birds to keep track of which birds belonged to each brood (Jenkins, et, al. 2014). The dataset includes both information on the specfic sites and individual birds. Some examples of data collected are: the adult bird band number, the site the bird was banded, the sex of the adult bird, the brood size, if the nest was the experimental or control, the presence of mites on the adult bird, and much more (Jenkins, et. al. 2014).
### The nature of the data:
#### The dataset is fairly large. It is a csv. file containing 7,168 lines of data. There is a lot of different variables that I could of looked at, but I chose to look at the glucocorticoid levels in baseline (initial disturbance) and in stress (secondary disturbance after the initial measurement). There are many variables that I could have examined, but due to the nature of the experiment already conducted, I felt as though it was most fitting to look at the different CORT levels over elapsed time.
### What the original authors did with data:
#### The researchers constructed a paternity analysis to determine the relatedness among nestlings (or "brood mates") (Jenkins, et. al. 2014). Since there is a high rate of extra-pair fertilization, or 'EPF' among barn swallows (Jenkins et. al. 2014).[Extra-pair fertilization](https://doi.org/10.1038/422833a.) is when "Female birds often copulate with males that are not their social partner" (Griffith and Montgomerie, 2014, 1). A pedigree was constructed from the genetic data that was obtained from the blood samples (Jenkins, et. al. 2014).  In order to determine if glucocorticoid hormone levels were due to either genetic or environmental factors (or both), the researchers calculated the additive genetic variance from the stress and baseline glucocorticoid levels (Jenkins, et. al. 2014). Through this method, they were able to determine total phenotypic variance (Jenkins, et. al. 2014).
### What I did with the data and how I did it:
#### I wanted to look at the relationship between baseline and stress glucocorticoid levels over elapsed time. Since there is two data points for most individuals, in which the first point correlates to the initial baseline or stress concentration, and the second point correlates to the CORT concentration of the bird during in baseline or stress; I constructed a visualization of the amount of glucocorticoid concentration for each individual over elapsed time. I mapped each individual's two points to begin, with a dotplot. Some individuals only had one point, and that is accounted for in the plot. I then connected the each individual's two values using a box plot, which calcluates the mean between the two values. I used elapsed time instead stress or baseline time because elapsed time accounted for the total amount of time it took for the researchers to collect samples for both baseline and stress CORT concentrations. I compared the two graphs side by side, so it is easier to visualize the effect of disturbance on the barn swallow CORT concentrations in both baseline and in stress. I lastly ran a two-way ANOVA test in order to determine if the interaction between baseline and stress CORT concentrations for individuals was significant over time.

## Results and Conclusions
#### I noticed that just based on the graphs, that disturbance does have an effect on glucocorticoid hormone concentration. I knew that I could not determine correlation without running a statistical test, so I ran a two-way ANOVA. Based on just the graphs and the data available, it is evident that CORT levels measured in baseline are lower than those measured in stress. I also noticed that the initial measurement taken in stress for the amount of CORT hormone is higher than 10 ng/mL for most individuals, and is usually in the inital range of 10-15 ng/mL. This is starkly different than in baseline because the inital value of CORT concentration is much lower, anywhere from 0-13 ng/mL. All the measurements taken for baseline and stress were taken by Jenkins et. al. in a matter of 7 hours and 15 minutes, from 14:00 hours to 21:15 hours. My reasoning for using these two variables was that maybe their interaction is significant when compared over elapsed time that it took to collect the samples. When I ran two-way ANOVA test, the Adjusted R-squared was -0.01294. This means that is there is no interaction between baseline CORT levels and stress CORT levels. The p-value I obtained was 0.689, which means the interaction is not significant.
#### This leads to the possibility of future analysis. In future analysis, I would like to look at the relationship between stress CORT levels over the amount of stress time. I also think it would be useful to look at the relationship between baseline CORT levels over baseline time. Jenkins et. al. did specify that the amount of time between the samples ranged from 15-60 minutes, which may account for the reasoning behind why baseline and stress CORT levels do not have a significant interaction when compared to one another over elapsed time. I would also like to analyze other aspects of the study, since there is so much data to look at.
